# Real-Time-cargo-Tracking
**Overview**

The Real-Time Cargo Tracking and Tamper Detection System is an IoT-based solution designed to provide continuous cargo monitoring, tamper alerts, and location tracking throughout the transportation process.

This project bridges the gap between cargo safety and real-time visibility in logistics operations by combining hardware sensors, GPS modules, and cloud-based analytics. It ensures that logistics companies and end users can track shipments, detect unauthorized access, and receive instant alerts in case of anomalies.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional cargo tracking systems rely only on GPS updates, offering location data but no security insights.
Such systems fail to detect tampering, environmental changes, or unauthorized access, leading to:

Loss or damage of goods,

Delayed detection of theft,

Low transparency in the supply chain.

💡 This project solves these problems by enabling real-time monitoring of both location and security status of the cargo using IoT sensors integrated with a web-based dashboard.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-Time Location Tracking: Continuous GPS updates to monitor cargo movement.
✅ Tamper Detection: Alerts generated if the cargo is opened or accessed without authorization.
✅ Environmental Monitoring: Records temperature/humidity changes for sensitive goods.
✅ Cloud Integration: Data is pushed to a cloud database for live monitoring.
✅ Web Dashboard: Displays cargo location, route, and tamper alerts in real-time.
✅ Scalable & Secure: Uses modern IoT architecture with API-based data transmission.

**Working Principle**

IoT Hardware Layer – A microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU / Raspberry Pi) connected with:

GPS module for live location,

Tamper sensor (Reed switch / IR sensor),

Temperature and humidity sensors.

Data Transmission Layer – Data is sent securely to a cloud server (Firebase / MongoDB / Thingspeak) via Wi-Fi or GSM.

Backend Processing – The server processes incoming data and updates cargo status.

Frontend Dashboard – A web or mobile dashboard visualizes location on maps and displays tamper alerts.
